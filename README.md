react-tornado-graphql-example
=============================

An example app using React, Tornado, and GraphQL.

The server-side GraphQL implementation is still naive and fragile.

Setup
-----

Install NPM packages:

```sh
% npm install
```

Install pip packages and register `tornado-graphql-example` pacakge:

```sh
% cd tornado
% pip install -r requirements.in
% python setup.py develop
```

Usage
-----

Launch the GraphQL API server:

```sh
% tornado-graphql-example run -d
```

Launch the development web server which serves the static client-side app:

```sh
% npm start
```

Frameworks/Libraries
--------------------

### Client-side (JavaScript)

* React
* Redux
* react-router and react-router-redux
* Apollo client (GraphQL integration)
* Semantic-UI-React (CSS framework)

The application code was generated by create-react-app.

See package.json for more information.

### Server-side (Python)

* Tornado
* Tornado CORS
* GraphQL-core

See tornado/requirements.in for more information.

Todo
----

* Create the independent `tornado-graphql` module same as `flask-graphql`
* Add missing GraphQL features and make the code robust
* GraphiQL integration
* Tests
* Background job processing using ZeroMQ (Tornado really shines with this!)
* Authentication
* GraphQL subscription
